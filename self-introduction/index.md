Hello! I'm Andrew, born in Belarus, residing in Minsk. 

In 2012 I graduated from Minsk State College of Digital Technologies and got qualified as a computer operator and an assembler of electronic and microelectronic equipment.

After my graduation for some time I worked as an on-site personal computer repair technician combining with cab services.

Once I went self-employed, bought some trucks, hired employees and started working within transportation around Minsk. Apart from it, I opened mini-cafe serving fast food. It lasted until 2022.

While all this experience I wouldn't even remember to go back to programming though it was at my liking during my education. Anyway, I followed all the news and updates in IT.

At the end of 2022 I decided to try myself in IT and took the course Stage 0 in RS School. It seemed complex at first and unclear but that boosted my interest more. I appreciated the approach and training techniques, the way the tasks and deadlines were set: no matter how much time and effort you spend at this, where you find the information, the main goal is the achievement. 

Apart from that, I was motivated with the ratings system when I wake up and check my results where I get higher from 2000 to 1500 place thanks to successful results from the task. Then it gets to 1000 and even better. This way I tried harder to succeed at my level.

Afterwards, I figured out that I cannot combine work and education so I decided to sell my business. Plus, the national environment was unstable and that influenced me too.

By taking Stage 1 course I already knew it will get even harder but Stage 0 allowed my to plunge in the whole process and get prepared to the main course. At this moment there're still some unclear to me points, something is complex but I make much effort to work it all out. By the way, I like the way our previous coding projects and current ones are compared all the time, this motivates as well when I'm not the only one seeing the difference.

Thanks you for your attention!
